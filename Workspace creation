ROS 2 humble Workspace Setup on Ubuntu 22.04

This guide walks you through creating and building a ROS 2 workspace using `colcon` in "Ubuntu 22.04" with "ROS 2 humble" installed.

---

Objective

To create a functional ROS 2 workspace (`ros2_ws`) for developing and running ROS 2 packages.

---

Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- ROS 2 humble installed (Verify using `ros2 --version`)
- Basic terminal knowledge

---

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Source ROS 2 humble

Before running ROS 2 commands, source the ROS 2 environment:
In the new terminal, source your main ROS 2 environment as the “underlay”, so you can build the overlay “on top of” it:
            
            source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash



Step 2: Create the Workspace

Create the ROS 2 workspace and its src folder: (On same terminal, enter following commands)

            mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
            

From the root of your workspace ros2_ws, you can now build your packages using the command:
           
            cd ~/ros2_ws
            colcon build

In the root, source your overlay:
            source install/local_setup.bash
